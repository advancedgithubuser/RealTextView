# RealTextView

A new TextView for Android that includes a compilation of libraries to make a real TextView.
A lot of good libraries out there, but always I had to import each one, why not to merge and improve
them in a unique library.

This is what RealTextView does. As well for Button, CheckBox and EditText.

## Features:

* Autofit TextView, set a desired size and a minimun size, and never worry about if a text fits</li>
* Set any kind of font, only to a textview or set it as a theme for all the TextViews</li>
* RealTextView and RealButton with indeterminate progress loading</li>
* HTML text view extension, use RealTextView with html String.</li>
